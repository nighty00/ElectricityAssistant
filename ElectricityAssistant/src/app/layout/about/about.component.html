          <p>Australia's electricity price has been going up by 20% since 1 July 2017. Electricity bills have become a big burden
            for many residents. Australia's national electrical energy consumption remains at a high level in the past decade.
            From our research, around 86 percent of our electricity is generated from fuels, with 73 percent from coal and
            13 percent from natural gas, this leads to extreme greenhouse emission which directly contributes to the global
            warming. Climate change has already been affecting Australia in many areas such as agriculture, Infrastructure
            and natural and cultural heritage.</p>
